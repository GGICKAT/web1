  Think</a> like a man of action and act like man of thought.</br>
<br>Courage is very important. Like a muscle, it is strengthened by use.</br>
<br>Life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises.</br>
<br>By doubting we come at the truth.</br>
<br>A man that hath no virtue in himself, ever envieth virtue in others.</br>
<br>When money speaks, the truth keeps silent.</br>

  <br>Better the last smile than the first laughter.</br>

<br>In the morning of life, work; in the midday, give counsel; in the evening, pray.</br>
<br>Painless poverty is better than embittered wealth.</br>
<br>A poet is the painter of the soul.</br>
<br>Error is the discipline through which we advance.</br>
<br>Faith without deeds is useless.</br>
<br>Weak things united become strong.</br>
<br>We give advice, but we cannot give conduct.</br>
<br>Nature never deceives us; it is always we who deceive ourselves.</br>
<br>Forgiveness is better than revenge.</br>
<br>We never know the worth of water till the well is dry.</br>
<br>Pain past is pleasure.</br>
